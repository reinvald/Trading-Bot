# Trading Bot

Very simple Python trading bot that uses a handful of APIs (and a surface level understanding of the stock market) to trade during open market times.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Simply run the main script after making sure all dependencies have been installed and after linking your API keys.

```bash
python main.py
```
